## Particle Library for Coral
A C/C++ package for managing multiple wifi-enabled devices on a single Photon.

### Introduction
The purpose of this library is to make it quick and easy to add and manage multiple devices on your Photon. 
With minimal setup, you will be able to change the state of any device hooked up to your Photon with HTTP requests.
For example, you could change the RGB value of multiple lights at the same time, turn a Servo motor that unlocks a door, receive sensor data from a thermometer, and more with a single line of JSON! 

Additionally, this package is built for integration with the Coral web platform.

### Setup
```C++
#include "coral.h"
```
To use the library, simply download and include the package. If you are using Particle Build, go to 'Libraries->Community Libraries'. Search "coral", and add the library to your project.
### Examples
```C++
